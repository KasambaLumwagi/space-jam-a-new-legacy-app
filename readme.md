# Basketball Stats Optimization with Visual Studio Code

Inspired by the film *Space Jam: A New Legacy*, this personal project aims to enhance basketball gameplay through data science and coding. By utilizing tools like Visual Studio Code, Azure, GitHub, JavaScript, and Python, you will analyze basketball data, build predictive models, and develop interactive web and mixed reality applications.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into several stages, each focusing on different aspects of data science and software development.

## Stage 1: Predict Basketball Player Efficiency Ratings

**Duration**: ~1 hr 1 min

**Objective**: Create a machine learning model to predict basketball player efficiency ratings using anonymized data from real and animated players.

### Procedures

1. **Set Up Your Local Environment**
   - Install Visual Studio Code and the Python Extension.
   - Set up a Python environment and install necessary packages.

2. **Data Cleansing**
   - Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.
   - Drop irrelevant columns and rows to clean the data.

3. **Data Exploration**
   - Check for outliers and analyze the distribution of the data.
   - Discover and interpret bimodal data distributions.

4. **Data Manipulation**
   - Add qualifying player information.
   - Impute missing values using basic methods and machine learning techniques.

5. **Model Training**
   - Train and evaluate a machine learning model to predict player efficiency.

6. **Knowledge Check**
   - Review and test your understanding with a brief quiz.

## Stage 2: Create a Web App for Basketball Data Decisions

**Duration**: ~1 hr 5 min

**Objective**: Develop a web app using JavaScript, Azure, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code that helps coaches make data-based decisions.

### Procedures

1. **Web App Development**
   - Use JavaScript and Visual Studio Code to build the web application.
   - Integrate data analysis and visualization features.

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the web app using Azure Static Web Apps.
   - Automate deployment with GitHub Actions.

3. **Testing**
   - Test the web app for functionality and performance.

## Stage 3: Prepare for Mixed Reality Experiences

**Duration**: ~20 min

**Objective**: Learn the fundamentals of Mixed Reality and prepare resources for interactive experiences.

### Procedures

1. **Learn Mixed Reality Basics**
   - Understand the core concepts of Mixed Reality.
   - Prepare resources and tools for development.

2. **Resource Preparation**
   - Set up necessary tools and environments for Mixed Reality development.

## Stage 4: Introduction to WebXR with Babylon.js

**Duration**: ~33 min

**Objective**: Build a simple WebXR app using Babylon.js to create cross-platform Mixed Reality experiences.

### Procedures

1. **WebXR Fundamentals**
   - Learn about WebXR and its capabilities.
   - Create a basic WebXR application.

2. **Cross-Platform Testing**
   - Test the app across different platforms to ensure compatibility.

## Stage 5: Create a Mixed Reality Basketball Player Lineup

**Duration**: ~1 hr 24 min

**Objective**: Develop an interactive VR experience using C#, Visual Studio, Unity, and the Mixed Reality Toolkit.

### Procedures

1. **VR Development**
   - Use Unity and the Mixed Reality Toolkit to create the VR experience.
   - Develop features to interact with a virtual basketball player lineup.

2. **HoloLens Compatibility**
   - Ensure the VR experience is compatible with HoloLens.
   - Test and refine the experience for users.
